        <h1>Studying Makes Me Hungry</h1>
        
        <p>OK, the karma gods must have been trying to balance off the rough start to your day, because truth be told, that first assignment was pretty easy. Yay!</p>
        
        <p>With lots of time to spare before you can leave, you figure you may as well grab a real bite to eat (no lunch from home today!).</p>
        
        <p>There are a few areas of campus with decent food choices, so pick whichever is most useful to you and head there now.</p>
