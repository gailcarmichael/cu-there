        <h1>Undergraduate Academic Support Office</h1>
        
        <p>The friendly folks at the <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/engineering-design/current-students/undergrad-academic-support/">Undergraduate Academic Support Office</a> are able to help you look at the courses you've picked and ensure you made the right choices.</p>
        
        <p>You note that you can also ask for various learning resources and extra support here, and even learn more about that Iron Ring you're going to be working so hard for. (Did you know the ceremony to receive your ring when you graduate is private, attended only by others with or receiving a ring? Cool!)</p>
        
        <p>Speaking of working hard, it's time for your first class: ECOR 1606. Better head to <span class="nextLocation">2256 Mackenzie Building</span> now!</p>
