        <h1>Treats, CTTC</h1>
        
        <p>After a scrumptious chocolatey muffin, you can't help but think about matters of health. You notice the nearby <a href="http://www1.carleton.ca/health/">health clinic</a> (they do walk-ins!) and note that the pharmacy is one floor down.</p>
        
        <p>You also notice that the co-op offices are in the same building. Even though co-op doesn't usually start until later in your degree, it's good to know where to come to ask about it. Many interviews happen at these offices, too.</p>
        
        <p>Satisfied that you know the ropes here, you decide to head to the <span class="nextLocation">Science Student Success Centre</span> in 3431 Herzberg Laboratories. You have some concerns about your upcoming year and hope to get some advice.</p>
