        <h1>Dean's Office</h1>
        
        <p>The friendly staff at the Dean's office are able to direct you to your own Program Advisor, who can help you figure out what courses you should take over time and other such things.</p>
        
        <p>You also learn that some of the degrees granted by the Faculty of Public Affairs are among the first ever granted at Carleton (journalism and public administration) - cool!</p>
        
        <p>But speaking of classes, it looks like it's time for your first one: PAPM 1000! Better head to <span class="nextLocation">111 Paterson Hall</span> now!</p>
