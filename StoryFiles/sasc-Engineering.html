        <h1>Student Academic Success Centre</h1>
        
        <p>Turns out the <a href="http://www1.carleton.ca/sasc/">Student Academic Success Centre</a> is associated with Learning Support Services, but also has other services that could come in handy. Some services are similar to the Undergraduate Academic Support Office, but there is something worth noting: PASS. Peer Assisted Study Sessions are workshops run by students and designed to help you strengthen your study skills by incorporating course content with student discussion. A good number of engineering and science classes have PASS.</p>
        
        <p>With all these resources available to you, you start to feel pretty confident about your ability to succeed at this whole university thing. You decide to check out <span class="nextLocation">Career Services</span> at 401 Tory because, as they say, it's never to early to be thinking about your future!</p>
