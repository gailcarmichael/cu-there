        <h1>Career Services</h1>
        
        <p>You thought you were just going to find job postings at <a href="http://www5.carleton.ca/cc/career/">Career Services</a>, but there's so much more! The workshops and career advising look especially promising.</p>
        
        <p>It's just about time to leave, and you can't help but notice that the <span class="nextLocation">Student Experience Office</span> is just down the hall. They're the ones that made this whole app possible, so you figure you may as well head over there to wrap this thing up!</p>
