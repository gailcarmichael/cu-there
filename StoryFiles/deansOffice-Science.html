        <h1>Science Student Success Centre</h1>
        
        <p>The friendly folks at the <a href="http://sssc.carleton.ca/">SSSC</a> are able to offer you all kinds of academic resources to make sure you succeed this year. From one-on-one mentoring to exam prep to career advice, they have it all! You can even use their space for group study sessions.</p>
        
        <p>As you leave the SSSC office, you go down one floor and find the Foucault pendulum swinging away. This pendulum appears to change where it's swinging, but it actually always stays in the exact same plane - it's the earth that moves relative to it!</p>
        
        <p>You are mesmerized with the pendulum, but this is broken when you realize it's time for your first class: Calculus. Better head to <span class="nextLocation">103 Steacie Building</span> now!</p>
