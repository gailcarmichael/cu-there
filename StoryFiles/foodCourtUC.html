        <h1>Food Court</h1>
        
        <p>You're thrilled to find so much variety in the <a href="http://www1.carleton.ca/dining/locations/food-court/">Food Court</a>, from burgers at 101's to something lighter at The Express Fridge.  It's also nice that the seating area has comfy couches as well as the usual tables and chairs.  This might be a good place to meet up with friends tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p>With a full tummy, you wonder where you should head next...</p>
