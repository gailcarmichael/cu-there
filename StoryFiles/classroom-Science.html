        <h1>103 Steacie Building</h1>
        
        <p>Uh oh! You show up to class late, sit down, and realize ten minutes in that it's the WRONG class!</p>
        
        <p>...</p>
        
        <p>Just kidding.  The class felt like it was over before it even started.</p>
        
        <p>The downside? You already have homework assigned! Since the day has barely begun, you figure you may as well hit the library and get started. Head to <span class="nextLocation">Learning Support Services</span> first.</p>
