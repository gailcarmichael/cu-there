        <h1>Tim Horton's, Athletics</h1>
        
        <p>You first check out the <a href="http://athletics.carleton.ca/">Athletic Centre's</a> amenities at the Welcome Centre (exercising really does help you focus on your academics and helps avoid that extra weight gain some people say new students are susceptible to!).</p>
        
        <p>You can't help but notice the pictures hanging on the wall opposite - did Carleton really win THAT many basketball championships in a row?! You tell yourself you must try to get to one of their games or spirit rallies during the year!</p>
        
        <p>Before leaving, you learn about the many awesome things your campus card gives you access to, like the pool and state of the art fitness centre. You also note the location of the gyms and field house, where many exams are written.</p>
        
        <p>Satisfied that you know the ropes here, you decide to head to <span class="nextLocation">your Dean's Office</span> in D391 Loeb. You have some questions about your classes that you hope to clear up.</p>
