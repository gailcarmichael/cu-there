        <p>You figure if any of the other useful places you've visited today can't help you, the <a href="http://www6.carleton.ca/seo/">Student Experience Office</a> will. It's amazing how many things they do, from Orientation to the Co-curricular Record, and with lots of academic and personal support services in between. Not only that, but you can find out how to take part in several unique volunteer opportunities through the SEO, from Carleton Serves to the Alternative Spring Break program.</p>
