        <h1>One of Those Days</h1>
        
        <p>You know those days when everything seems to goes wrong? This has been one of those days.</p>
        
        <p>Figures, too, since you are a new student here at Carleton.  It's not like you know your way around very well.  At least, not yet.</p>
        
        <p>You may as well start at the beginning.  You still owe for tuition, so head to <span class="nextLocation">Student Accounts Receivable at the Business Office</span> in Robertson Hall to settle your account.</p>
