        <p><span class="nextLocation">CUOL</span> might just be the answer to getting into that popular course you need (or just a way to catch up on missed lectures!). Courses that are recorded can be accessed via Internet streaming, on a pay-per-lecture basis, over cable, or even with rental DVDs. If you watch the lecture live on TV or the web, then it's free! Head to the office in the Loeb tunnel to figure it all out.</p>
