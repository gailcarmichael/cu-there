        <h1>Student Academic Success Centre</h1>
        
        <p>Turns out the <a href="http://www1.carleton.ca/sasc/">Student Academic Success Centre</a> is associated with Learning Support Services.  You know that science students have their own success centre, but there are still services here worth noting. For example, Peer Assisted Study Sessions are workshops run by students and designed to help you strengthen your study skills by incorporating course content with student discussion. A few science classes, like chemistry, have PASS.</p>
        
        <p>With all these resources available to you, you start to feel pretty confident about your ability to succeed at this whole university thing. You decide to check out <span class="nextLocation">Career Services</span> at 401 Tory because, as they say, it's never to early to be thinking about your future!</p>
