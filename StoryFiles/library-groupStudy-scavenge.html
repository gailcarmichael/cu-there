        <p>There are currently 9 <a href="http://www.library.carleton.ca/services/group-study-rooms">group study rooms</a> in the library. Each room is a privately enclosed space containing a large table, comfortable chairs, and a whiteboard.  Carleton University students may use any of these rooms to study in groups or to work collaboratively on projects. Rooms may be booked through Carleton Central.</p>
