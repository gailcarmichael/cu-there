        <p>Glad to know where the <a href="http://cusaonline.ca/">CUSA</a> offices are, you take a quick glance at your watch. You still have a fair bit of time to kill before your ride is ready to head home. You may as well get your campus card ready, so you head to <span class="nextLocation">Info Carleton</span> on the fourth floor of Unicentre.</p>
