        <p>Maybe you should swing by the <span class="nextLocation">Bookstore</span> on first floor Unicentre and check out this year's text books. While you're there, you can also pick up a sweet Carleton hoodie so you can show your pride at the next basketball game (who wouldn't want to cheer on Canada's powerhouse?).</p>
