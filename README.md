# CU There

CU There is a QR-enabled branching story adventure that helps new Carleton University students learn their way around campus and the services available to them here.

The engine that drives the story reads a plist file and displays simple HTML webpages, so it can easily be customized for other contexts.  Stories can currently include branching points and scavenger hunts.

More information and the QR codes used to drive the current story are available here: http://gailcarmichael.com/cuthere
